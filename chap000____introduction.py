if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

# * When you run a program, OS loads your program into memory
# * OS then call for a startup routine provided by the language runtime
# * Startup routine looks for main() -  this is defined as starting point
# * It is a standard convention

# *  Every python file(module) has a built in variable called __name__
# * If file is run directly -> then python sets __name__ == "__main__"
# * If file is imported into another file (like import myScript) then  __name__ = "<module_name>"

# A language runtime, or runtime system, refers to the environment in which a program written in a specific programming
# language executes. It encompasses everything needed for the program to run, including interpreters, virtual machines,
# garbage collectors, standard libraries, and other supporting components.






"""
Python is a widely used programming language for creating real-world applications. It is extensively used in:

Data Science
Artificial Intelligence
Automation
Testing
Backend Development
Thus, learning Python offers significant advantages for your career opportunities.

However, there are certain fields where Python doesn't excel. For example, if you are interested in frontend development,
 game development, or mobile app development, then Python is not the best choice.

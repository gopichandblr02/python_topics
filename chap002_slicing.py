Out-of-bound slicing
In Python, list slicing allows out-of-bound indexing without raising errors. If we specify indices beyond the list length
then it will simply return the available items.
Example: The slice a[7:15] starts at index 7 and attempts to reach index 15, but since the list ends at index 8, so it 
will return only the available elements (i.e. [8,9]).
"""
b = [1,2,3,4]
print(b[2:20])   #[3, 4]
"""
Negative Indexing
Negative indexing is useful for accessing elements from the end of the list. The last element has an index of -1, the 
second last element -2, and so on.
"""
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
# Get elements starting from index -2
# to end of list
b = a[-2:]
print(b)
# Get elements starting from index 0
# to index -3 (excluding 3th last index)
c = a[:-3]
print(c)
# Get elements from index -4
# to -1 (excluding index -1)
d = a[-4:-1]
print(d)
# Get every 2nd elements from index -8
# to -1 (excluding index -1)
e = a[-8:-1:2]
print(e)
# [8, 9]
# [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
# [6, 7, 8]
# [2, 4, 6, 8]
# Reverse a list using slicing
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
# Get the entire list using negative step
b = a[::-1]
print(b) # [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
